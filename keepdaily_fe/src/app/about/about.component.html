    <p>
        Cake was born as a birthday gift for my dear Mr. Tseng, with the intention of encouraging and supporting his journey towards a healthier life.

        Life is a journey filled with countless moments that deserve to be celebrated, from personal achievements and milestones to simple joys and daily wins. Cake is here to be your faithful companion on this journey, helping you capture these moments, one photo at a time.
